# WatchShelf sidecar

Your Audiobookshelf library is mostly **single files of 200 MB – 1 GB** (a 25-hour
audiobook is one 1 GB file). A Garmin watch cannot download a file that big in one
request, and it can't accept an ABS "item detail" response big enough to *list* a
many-file book. So this tiny Node + ffmpeg service sits in front of ABS, and **the
watch talks to only the sidecar** — ABS itself never has to be exposed to the
internet:

- **`/login`** — proxies to ABS `/login`, returns just `{user:{token}}`.
- **`/libraries`, `/continue`, `/list`, `/authors`, `/series`, `/collections`,
  `/files`** — lean JSON (a few KB) so listings never overflow the watch.
  `/continue` returns the user's started, unfinished books; `/files` also includes
  the saved position used to skip already-listened chunks.
- **`/transcode`** — cuts a small on-demand AAC chunk at the selected speed (real
  M4A/MP4 container, so
  the watch's native player knows the exact duration and can show a position bar)
  out of any file using an HTTP Range request (it never downloads the whole
  gigabyte — a 3-min chunk is ~2 MB).
- **`/cover`** — the book's cover image, resized by ABS, for menu thumbnails and
  the player's album art.
- **`/progress`** — forwards the watch's position and final `isFinished` state as a
  real `PATCH` to ABS (Monkey C has no PATCH method).

It auths with the **watch's own ABS token** (obtained via `/login`, then passed
per-request), so there is no separate secret to configure. The only required setting
is `ABS_URL` — Audiobookshelf's address *as seen from this container/host* (an
internal address is fine and preferred, since the sidecar is now the only thing that
needs to be public).

## Deploy — one command

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JediBrooker/WatchShelf/main/sidecar/install.sh)"
```

This clones the repo, asks where Audiobookshelf runs, starts the sidecar with
Docker, and then walks you through exposing it over HTTPS with whichever reverse
proxy you already use (Cloudflare Tunnel / nginx / Apache / Caddy / Traefik) —
for nginx/Apache/Caddy it creates a **new, separate** config file and always
asks before touching anything; your existing Audiobookshelf config is never
edited. Safe to re-run.

Prefer to do it by hand, or want to understand each step first? See
[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) — the same steps, explained.

## Deploy — by hand (Docker, ~2 min)

1. In `docker-compose.yml`, set `ABS_URL` to ABS's address as seen from this
   container (`http://host.docker.internal:13378` if ABS runs on the host, or the
   compose service name if it's a sibling container — see the comments in the file).
2. `docker compose up -d --build`
3. Expose the sidecar over HTTPS with **whatever reverse proxy you already run** —
   see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for a plain step-by-step guide, one
   for each of Cloudflare Tunnel, nginx, Apache, Caddy, and Traefik.
4. Verify: `curl https://<whatever you exposed>/health` → `ok`.
5. On the watch, log in with that URL — **not** your ABS server's URL.

That's it — browse and download a book.

## Or bare Node

`ABS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:13378 node server.js` (needs Node 18+ and `ffmpeg` on
PATH), then expose it the same way (step 3 above).

## Tuning

- **Chunk length** is ~3 min (first chunk 15 s so playback can be tested right
  after a sync starts), set in the watch app (`source/Chunks.mc`, `FIRST`/`LEN`).
  Smaller → more, smaller downloads; larger → fewer, bigger.
- **Quality** is 96 kbps mono AAC in an M4A container (spoken-word sweet spot;
  the real container is what gives the player a duration). Change in `server.js`
  `ffArgs`.
- **Playback speed** supports 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2.0x via ffmpeg
  `atempo`; progress remains on the original timeline.
