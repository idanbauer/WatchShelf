// Downloads queued books to the device media cache, one derived chunk at a
// time. One chunk == one Media track, so the native player gives real chapter
// navigation. Works from the per-book jobs in JobStore - chunk boundaries
// come from Chunks.at(), and each downloaded refId is recorded via
// BookStore.saveChunk (position == chunk index, overwrite-safe). Nothing here
// is ever O(chunks) - or O(queued books x files) - in a single Storage value
// (see Constants.mc for the OOM post-mortem).
//
// STORAGE DISCIPLINE: queue state is read FRESH at every step and only
// read-modify-written - never held in a long-lived field and persisted
// wholesale. A snapshot design silently clobbered any queue change made while
// a sync was running (book queued mid-sync erased after "Queued!" was shown;
// "Clear queue" undone seconds later) and let a deleted book's job survive
// deletion, resurrecting the book with its head chunks permanently missing.
//

// SEPARATE class (not a subtype), so returning one violates the declared
// contract. Do NOT "fix" this back to Media.SyncDelegate to match the GitHub
// MonkeyMusic sample - that sample is 2018-era and predates the type change;
